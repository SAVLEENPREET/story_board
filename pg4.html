        The Fairy Godmother told Cinderella to go to the ball and have fun. She added, “Remember my child, all this magic spell
        will vanish at the stroke of midnight. Come back before that.
                Cinderella promised to be back before midnight and left happily for the ball in the carriage drawn by Gus and Jaq. When
                Cinderella arrived at the palace, she was surprised to see a place so majestic and a ball so grand. There were so many
                young ladies escorted by their mothers. Everyone wanted to impress the Prince.

                When Cinderella entered the royal ball, all heads turned to see her. She looked like a dream. No one happened to
                recognize her, even her stepmother and stepsisters were awestruck to see a girl so beautiful. Cinderella walked into the
                ballroom with her head held high. She looked so royal that everyone thought her to be some princess.

                The Prince couldn’t take his eyes off Cinderella. He walked to her and introduced himself. Cinderella bowed down and
                greeted the Prince. He asked her out for a dance. They talked, laughed, and kept dancing to every song. The other young
                ladies at the ball became jealous of Cinderella.
