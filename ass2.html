      <h3 style="color: brown; padding-left: 4%; padding-right: 3%;">Once upon a time, there was a beautiful,
        kind-hearted girl called
        Cinderella, who lived in a far far away land. She
        lived with her stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and two step-sisters, Anastasia and Drizella. As her stepmother was
        not
        very
        fond of her, she had asked Cinderella to live in the attic. Two cute little mice named Gus and Jaq and the
        chirping
        birds became her best friends in her new room.<br>
        <div class="uuu" style="padding-top: 3%;">

          Her stepmother and stepsisters made her do all their household chores. Cinderella woke up early in the morning
          when it
          was still all dark to start the fire for their household. She cooked all meals, worked in the kitchen, and
          kept
          the fire
          going to warm their house. Poor Cinderella used to get ashes and cinders all over her clothes and body from
          the
          fire.<br>

        <div class="yy" style="padding-top: 3%;">
          People say her real name was Ella, but her stepsisters and stepmother called her Cinderella as she always had
          cinders on
          her clothes.
          Anastasia and Drizella were arrogant and quarrelsome. They never happened to like Cinderella much and made her
          life
          miserable.<br>

          They made her run on errands for them. Cooking, sewing, and cleaning were all done by Cinderella.
          Lady Tremaine enjoyed seeing Cinderella work so hard. She cunningly gave extra work to Cinderella, like asking
          her
          to
          bathe her cat, Lucifer. She did everything that she could to make Lady Tremaine, Anastasia, and Drizella
          happy.
