        One fine morning, the king’s messengers came riding on their horses and announced that the King and the Queen had
        invited all the maiden ladies of the kingdom to a royal ball. The King and the Queen were to find the Prince a lovely
        bride. The young ladies were overjoyed with this news. They started to decide on their best ball gowns and jewellery.<br>
        
        <div class="ss" style="padding-top: 3%;">
        Soon, the king’s messenger arrived at Cinderella’s home and handed over the invitation to the ball. Lady Tremaine now
        ordered Cinderella to stitch two beautiful new gowns for Anastasia and Drizella for the royal ball. <br>She kept Cinderella
        busy with more chores so that she wouldn’t be going to the ball. Cinderella wished to go to the ball as well. So, she
        found her mother’s old dress from her trunk. She thought to herself that she could make the dress into a beautiful new
        one fit for the royal ball.
        <br></div>
        <div class="dd" style="padding-top: 3%;">
         
        Soon, the day of the royal ball arrived, and Anastasia and Drizella were dressed up in the beautiful gowns stitched by
        Cinderella. Meanwhile, in the attic, Gus and Jaq, the two little mice, and the birds had turned Cinderella’s mother’s
        old dress into a beautiful one. They had used the ribbons and beads thrown away by Cinderella’s stepsisters to make
        Cinderella’s dress.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="kk" style="padding-top: 3%;">
        
        Cinderella was very happy to see her new dress done by the mice and the birds. She thanked her little friends and
        thought to herself that she could go to the ball now.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="tt" style="padding-top: 3%;">
        But her stepsisters flew into a terrible rage when they saw her in that beautiful dress. They pulled out the ribbons and
        beads to destroy her dress. They ripped off the beautiful dress that Cinderella wore.</div>
