                    As the evening went on, Cinderella and the Prince became more engrossed in each other’s company. The
                    Prince was smitten
                    by her charm and beauty. Cinderella had never been happier. Suddenly, she heard ‘Dong’, ‘Dong!’ It
                    was the clock that
                    was about to strike 12. She looked up at the big royal clock at the palace and found that it was
                    almost midnight.

                <div class="pe" style="padding-top: 2%; color: blue;">
                    As she was hurrying down the stairs, one of her glass slippers came off her feet but she didn’t stop
                    to pick it up and
                    left the palace. The magic spell had started to wear off. The Prince followed her to the stairs. “I
                    don’t even know your
                    name,” he called out to her
                </div>
                <div class="pe" style="padding-top: 2%; color: blue;">
                    The Prince found her glass slipper on the stairs. He realised that it was a special glass slipper
                    that could
                    only fit
                    Cinderella’s foot. So the next day, he started to look for the other slipper. He went from one house
                    to
                    another and
                    tried to find the right fit for the glass slipper. All the young ladies were trying to wear the
                    glass
                    slipper, but it
                    didn’t fit any of them.

                <div class="pe" style="padding-top: 2%; color: blue;">
                    Finally, the Prince arrived at Cinderella’s house. Lady Tremaine’s daughters were all ready to try
                    the glass
                    slipper,
                    but it didn’t fit their feet. The Prince asked if there was any other young lady in the house.
                    Though they
                    refused to
                    tell the Prince about Cinderella, he found her working in the house. He got down on his knee and
                    insisted
                    she tried the
                    glass slipper. It was a perfect fit for Cinderella’s foot.
